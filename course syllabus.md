# 📚 Course Syllabus: Mathematical Foundations & Cryptography for Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems

Welcome to the course! This syllabus outlines the key topics we will cover, split into two complementary tracks:

- **Math Track (Tuesday Sessions):** Foundational mathematical concepts, algebra, and polynomial structures that underpin modern cryptographic protocols.
- **Crypto Track (Thursday Sessions):** Applied cryptography with a special focus on Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems (ZKPs), from basic cryptographic primitives to advanced ZK techniques and real-world implementations.

> ⚠️ Note: This structure is flexible. The pace and depth may vary depending on the class's familiarity and progress.
