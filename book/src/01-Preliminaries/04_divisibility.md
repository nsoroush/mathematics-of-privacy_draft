# 🎉 A Fun Exploration of Numbers

Before we dive into the more difficult topic of modular division, let’s first **play around** with modular operations, solve **interesting problems**, **show off** our math skills, and **challenge** ourselves and others!

## ✨ How Numbers Are Built in Base 10

First, let’s quickly recall **how numbers are constructed** in our familiar decimal (base-10) system.

Any integer can be expressed as a **sum of powers of 10** multiplied by digits between 0 and 9.

For example, the number 165:
\\[
165 = 1 \times 10^2 + 6 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0
\\]
meaning:
- 1 hundred,
- 6 tens,
- 5 ones.

Similarly:
\\[
728 = 7 \times 10^2 + 2 \times 10^1 + 8 \times 10^0
\\]

In general, if a number has digits \\(d_k d_{k-1} \dots d_1 d_0\\), then:
\\[
\text{Number} = d_k \times 10^k + d_{k-1} \times 10^{k-1} + \dots + d_1 \times 10^1 + d_0 \times 10^0
\\]

## 🔥 Why This Matters for Divisibility

When checking divisibility rules (like for 2, 3, 5, 9, or 11), we **exploit how powers of 10 behave modulo small numbers**.

For example:
- Since \\(10 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}\\), every \\(10^k\\) behaves like 1 modulo 9 — leading to the **sum of digits** trick for divisibility by 9.
- Since \\(10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}\\), powers of 10 **alternate** between \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\) modulo 11 — leading to the **alternating sum** trick for divisibility by 11.

Thus, understanding the **base-10 expansion** is the key to **modular divisibility shortcuts**!

> **Athena:** Now, if you want to check whether a number is divisible by **10**, what should you do?  
> **Hermes:** Easy! Just check its **last digit** — if it’s 0, then it’s divisible by 10.  
> **Athena:** Exactly!  
> **Athena:** What about finding the remainder modulo **10**?  
> **Hermes:** Simple again! Just the **last digit**!  
> **Athena:** And divisibility by **5**?  
> **Hermes:** Check if the last digit is 0 or 5!  
> **Athena:** Perfect!  
> **Hermes (excited):** Wait, so it must also work for divisibility by **2** — just check if the last digit is even!  
> **Athena:** Yes, precisely! Divisibility by 2, 5, and 10 depends only on the last digit.  
> **Hermes (confident):** Then, if someone asks, "What's the remainder of \\(167254329 \mod 7\\)?", I just look at the last digit 9, and since \\(9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\\), the remainder must be 2. So simple!  
> **Athena (laughing):** Not so fast! That doesn’t always work.  
> For example:
> - \\(261\\) is divisible by 3,  
> - but its last digit is 1!
>  
> **Hermes (confused):** Wait, I'm lost... Why does it work for 2, 5, 10 — but not for 3, 7, or 9?  
> **Athena (smiling):** Great question! Let’s take a **deeper look** at why.

# 📚 Why Last-Digit Tricks Work for 10, 5, and 2

> **Hermes:** Why does checking just the last digit work nicely for 10, 5, and 2 — but not for others?

**Athena:**  
It all comes down to **how powers of 10 behave modulo \\(n\\)**.

---

Let’s take a number, say 4687:
\\[
4687 = 4 \times 10^3 + 6 \times 10^2 + 8 \times 10^1 + 7 \times 10^0
\\]

Now, computing \\(4687 \mod 10\\):
- \\(4 \times 10^3 \mod 10 = 0\\)
- \\(6 \times 10^2 \mod 10 = 0\\)
- \\(8 \times 10^1 \mod 10 = 0\\)
- \\(7 \times 10^0 \mod 10 = 7\\)

Adding:
\\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 7
\\]

Thus:
\\[
4687 \equiv 7 \pmod{10}
\\]
✅ Only the **last digit matters** when reducing modulo 10!

---

### 🧠 Why does this happen?

Because:
\\[
10 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}, \quad 10^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}, \quad 10^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}, \quad \text{etc.}
\\]

Thus, all higher terms vanish modulo 10.

Similarly, for 5 and 2:
- \\(10 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\\),
- \\(10 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\\),
and higher powers behave the same way.

Thus:

| Divides by | Why Last Digit Works |
|------------|----------------------|
| 2 | \\(10^k \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\\) for \\(k \geq 1\\) |
| 5 | \\(10^k \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\\) |
| 10 | \\(10^k \equiv 0 \pmod{10}\\) |

✅ Only the last digit matters!

---

> **Hermes:** But for 7, it fails?  
> **Athena:** Yes! Because \\(10 \pmod{7} = 3\\), so powers of 10 modulo 7 cycle and don't vanish. The last digit alone won't help — more information is needed!

---

# 🔥 Why Divisibility by 9 Depends on the Sum of Digits

Let's now see divisibility by **9**.

First, observe:
\\[
10 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \quad \text{for all } k
\\]

Thus:
- \\(10 \equiv 1\\),
- \\(10^2 \equiv 1\\),
- \\(10^3 \equiv 1\\),
- etc.

✅ Every term behaves like multiplying by 1!

Thus, for a number:
\\[
N = d_k \times 10^k + d_{k-1} \times 10^{k-1} + \dots + d_1 \times 10^1 + d_0
\\]
we have:
\\[
N \equiv d_k + d_{k-1} + \dots + d_1 + d_0 \pmod{9}
\\]
Meaning the number is congruent to the **sum of its digits modulo 9**.

---

### Example:

Check if 729 is divisible by 9.

- Sum of digits: \\(7 + 2 + 9 = 18\\)
- \\(18 \div 9 = 2\\) → divisible.

Thus:
\\[
729 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
\\]

---

> **Hermes:** Wow, so to check divisibility by 9, I just add up the digits!

> **Athena:** Exactly! If the sum of digits is divisible by 9, so is the whole number.

---

# 🧠 Now You Try! Divisibility by 3

> **Athena:**  
Now, **your turn**, dear reader! 🎯

- How do powers of 10 behave modulo 3?
- Can you guess why **sum of digits** helps check divisibility by 3?

✏️ **Mini Exercise:**  
Try a few numbers (like 153, 246, 111) and check if they are divisible by 3 by **summing the digits**.

💬 > **Hermes (whispering):**  
I have a feeling it’s very similar to divisibility by 9... 😎

---

# 🔮 Divisibility by 11 (Hint)

**Athena (teasing):**  
But beware — divisibility by **11** is trickier!

Here's your hint:

- \\(10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}\\)
- \\(10^2 \equiv 1\\),
- \\(10^3 \equiv -1\\),
- and so on!

Thus, powers of 10 **alternate** between \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\) modulo 11.

✅ To check divisibility by 11:
- **Add and subtract** digits **alternately**!

We'll dive into it next! 🚀
Love it! 😄  
Let’s keep the momentum and now **add a new section** explaining divisibility by **4** and **8**, following the same lively Athena–Hermes style and well-organized lecture format!

Here’s the **new clean section**:

---

# ✨ Divisibility by 4 and 8: Just Look at the Last Digits!

> **Hermes:**  
Athena, what about divisibility by **4** and **8**?  
Do we have some shortcut for them too?

---

**Athena (smiling):**  
Absolutely! Divisibility by **4** and **8** also has nice tricks — but instead of just the last digit, you have to check the **last two or three digits**.

Let’s break it down:

---

## 🔵 Divisibility by 4

**Rule:**  
A number is divisible by 4 **if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4**.

---

### 📚 Why?

Because:

- \\(100 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}\\),
- \\(1000 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}\\),
- \\(10000 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}\\), etc.

Thus, all parts except the last two digits vanish modulo 4.  
Only the **last two digits** matter!

---

### 🧠 Example:

Is 3,412 divisible by 4?

- Look at the last two digits: 12.
- \\(12 \div 4 = 3\\) exactly → divisible!

Thus:
\\[
3412 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
\\]

✅

---

> **Hermes:**  
So for 4, it's about **two digits** instead of just one?

> **Athena:**  
Exactly!

---

## 🔵 Divisibility by 8

**Rule:**  
A number is divisible by 8 **if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8**.

---

### 📚 Why?

Because:

- \\(1000 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}\\),
- \\(10000 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}\\),
- \\(100000 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}\\), etc.

Thus, only the **last three digits** matter for divisibility by 8!

---

### 🧠 Example:

Is 7,416 divisible by 8?

- Look at the last three digits: 416.
- \\(416 \div 8 = 52\\) exactly → divisible!

Thus:
\\[
7416 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
\\]

✅

---

> **Hermes:**  
Wow, so it's "last 2 digits" for 4 and "last 3 digits" for 8!

> **Athena:**  
Exactly!  
It's all about how powers of 10 behave modulo 4 and 8!

---

# 🧩 Quick Summary: Divisibility Based on Last Digits

| Divides by | What to Check |
|------------|---------------|
| 2 | Last **1 digit** (evenness) |
| 4 | Last **2 digits** |
| 8 | Last **3 digits** |
| 5 | Last **1 digit** (0 or 5) |
| 10 | Last **1 digit** (0) |

---

# 🧠 Practice Time!

Check divisibility without full division:

1. Is 17,532 divisible by 4?
2. Is 254,816 divisible by 8?
3. Is 31,205 divisible by 5?
4. Is 29,824 divisible by 4 and by 8?
Perfect! You're absolutely right —  
**Divisibility by 6** is a **combination rule** — you check **divisibility by both 2 and 3**.

Let’s now add a **new section** about divisibility by **6**, continuing the same clean, energetic, Hermes–Athena dialogue style:

---

# ✨ Divisibility by 6: Two Checks in One!

> **Hermes:**  
Athena, what about divisibility by **6**?  
Is there a shortcut too?

---

**Athena (smiling):**  
Yes! Divisibility by **6** is simple:  
You just need to check **divisibility by 2 and 3 at the same time**.

---

## 🔵 Divisibility by 6

**Rule:**  
A number is divisible by 6 **if and only if**:
- It is divisible by **2** (i.e., even number),
- **AND** divisible by **3** (i.e., sum of digits divisible by 3).

✅ **Both conditions must be satisfied!**

---

### 📚 Why?

Because:
- \\(6 = 2 \times 3\\),
- and 2 and 3 are **coprime** (they have no common factors).

Thus, divisibility by 6 requires satisfying both divisibility conditions separately.

---

### 🧠 Example 1:

Is 234 divisible by 6?

- Last digit: 4 → even → divisible by 2 ✅
- Sum of digits: \\(2+3+4=9\\) → 9 divisible by 3 ✅

Thus:
\\[
234 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}
\\]

✅ Divisible by 6!

---

### 🧠 Example 2:

Is 351 divisible by 6?

- Last digit: 1 → odd → **not divisible by 2** ❌
- Sum of digits: \\(3+5+1=9\\) → divisible by 3 ✅

Since it **fails divisibility by 2**,  
\\(351\\) is **NOT divisible** by 6!

---

> **Hermes:**  
Ahh, so I have to check **both** — not just one!

> **Athena:**  
Exactly!  
- Divisible by 2 → number is even.  
- Divisible by 3 → sum of digits divisible by 3.

✅ Only then, divisible by 6.

---

# 🧠 Quick Summary

| Divides by | What to Check |
|------------|---------------|
| 2 | Even number (last digit even) |
| 3 | Sum of digits divisible by 3 |
| 6 | **Both**: divisible by 2 **and** 3 |

---
